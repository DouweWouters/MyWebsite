            <p>Hi, I'm Douwe Wouters, a 22-year-old industrial design student at the University of Ghent at Kortrijk, born in Antwerp. 
                I have a passion for designing functional and aesthetically pleasing products, especially in the automotive industry and motorsport. 
                When I'm not studying, I love to learn more about these areas of design and attend car shows for inspiration. 
                I also enjoy working on side projects and spending time with friends and family. 
                I'm excited to use my skills to make a positive impact in the world, whether it's through designing sustainable solutions or innovative products.</p>
